* Bodie-0.3.5-HIPPY-stable

This release brings  improvements to the peer-to-peer search, fixes
a few bugs, and adds functionalities to Seeks.

- Fixes a computational blowup when expanding queries in P2P search.

- Improved detection of dead peers and their monitoring.

- Added default support for Delicious as a feed.

- Added support for Wordpress search results as a feed.

- Added support for Redmine search results as a feed.

- Fixed a bad encoding of some result titles.

- Fix to the Bing result parser.
	
- Fix to the Yahoo result grabber.

- there's now a --enable-personalization option to the configure
  script. When set to 'no' it allows to disable all personalization
  features, turning Seeks into a generic meta-search engine.

- An embryo of a no-tracking plugin, that implements HTTP header
  monitoring for avoiding smart tracking of users (e.g. through the
  'Last-Modified' header, ...).

- Fixes to the JSON output.

- Many bug fixes.

* DiAngelo-0.3.4-HIPPY-stable

First release with peer-to-peer activated as default. Every Seeks node
defines a list of Seeks peers to work with. This list defines a
ring of trusted peers. In future versions, the list will be updated
automatically, before a DHT takes over.

- Pure Seeks results: results now include data coming from the Seeks
  network (other peers) and not exclusively from feeds and search
  engines in the pipe.

- Default UI now includes peer information and recommendations.
	
- Implements three P2P call types over HTTP: per-key db access using Tokyo
  Tyrant, query fragment key extraction from Seeks node directly, and
  'batch' P2P query calls that fetch the whole halo of similar queries
  from a distant Seeks node (default).

- Automatic detection and testing of dead peers. Dead peers are marked back as
  alive when they are confirmed to operate correctly.
	
- libevent-2.x support is now default, see
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110701064850.GA1476%40hyperion.musicophages&forum_name=seeks-users

- new threaded and interleaved calls to feeds and remote Seeks peers.

- new threaded collaborative filter, with improved local filtering (local
  user control on all results, including those coming from other peers,
  avoids spam or preferences to be overriden).
	
- Many leaks and bug fixes.

- Added special flag to disable OpenCV, as the library seems partly broken
  on Debian testing & sid. See:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=20110701091640.GA3016%40hyperion.musicophages&forum_name=seeks-users
	
* DiAngelo-0.3.3-SOLO-stable

- Reworked parser and feeds / search engines connection. Allows using the
  same parser over several feeds. Each feed can be accessed independently
  from the API.

- Added support for the following result formats: opensearch (ATOM & RSS),
  dokuwiki and mediawiki.
	
- Slightly improved personalization over halos of similar queries.
	
- Few bug fixes, on personalization and on parsers.

- User db optimization is now optional.

- Improved exception model and handling in all plugins.

- Added info API call to HTTP server plugin.

- Many fixes to JSON search output.

- Support for remote user database, for personalization and other means.
  This allows to deport the user database away from the Seeks node itself.
  It is the first step towards enabling of a mixture of remote user
  profiles, in forthcoming version.

- Personalization using remote user database.

- Added new user db remote service plugin (udb-service) to serve user
  database records remotely, over HTTP.

- Added support for Tokyo Tyrant.
 
	
* DiAngelo-0.3.2-SOLO-stable

  user feedback that is taken into account in ranking and recommendation.

- Added automated recommendation of queries, URLs (more results to a query).
  Uses an improved query-to-query weighted distance.

- Added support for remote user database with Tokyo Tyrant.

- Several bug fixes, from language detection to missing results from search
  engine parsers.

  (includes optional support for libICU).

- Fixed minor leaks.

- Cleaner destruction of objects at node shutdown.

- Fixed encoding with Blekko parser.

  with no dependency to the inner machinery.

- Added dynamic JSON-based User Interface with basic features. Faster
  to use, and ready to be plugged to the p2p net when it is released.

  fix for dbs that may have been affected by the bug, so this remains
  transparent for the users and node maintainers.

- Added generic export framework to the user db. Thanks to sileht
  for the good work.

- Added Blekko to the search engine parsers.
