# Write lists for regexps as follows:
# * if the list contains patterns you want to block, put a + before the list;
# * if the list contains exclusion patterns you do not want to block, put a
#   - before the list.
#
# Example:
# +
# ad.*
# .*ads.
#
# -
# adsl.
# adu*.
#
# To block incoming queries, use lines of the type:
#
# +
# .seeks.*/search\?q=porn*
#
# where x.seeks.x is the address of your Seeks node.
