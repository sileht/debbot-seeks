# query result clicks interception mode.
# 'redirect' is default, and captures clicks on search results by
# pointing the clicked URL through the Seeks node first, and then
# redirecting to the URL. 
# 'capture' is detection of clicks from search results by the proxy
# itself. It is slightly heavier, but allows to avoid the redirection.

# protection against abusive use of the URL redirection scheme.
# 'Redirect' mode-intercept for query capture uses a URL redirection
# scheme, similar to a proxy. On public nodes this scheme can be abused
# to hit the nodes with redirection calls for URLs that do not appear
# among search results. This option activates a minimal protection.
