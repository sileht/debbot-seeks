# Sets the interval of time in seconds between two sweeps 
# of old URI records in the user DB.
# It is recommended to set sweeps every few days, weeks or 
# months, not every seconds as every sweep requires a traversal
# of the full DB.
# default: 2592000  # one month.
uc-sweep-cycle 2592000

# Sets the retention of records, in seconds.
# default: 15552000  # six months.
