3. Running Seeks

This is an early version of Seeks, it is recommended your run it from the
repository you compiled it from.

cd src
./seeks

see ./seeks --help for options.

For example, by default seeks does not run as a daemon. If you would like
to have it so, run ./seeks --daemon

Other important options can be modified in the configuration file, src/config

By default, seeks runs as proxy on the local machine (127.0.0.1) on port 8118.

Once started, to use seeks, tell your web browser to connect to the Internet
through seeks' web proxy.
